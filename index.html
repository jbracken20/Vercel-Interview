            <h1>Here is waht I have learned recently</h1>
            <p>I recently learned about the basics of Python and JavaScript. I am not a Software Engineer by trade, but if I can continue to learn and hone my craft it will help in my ability to help my careers grow!</p>    
            <p>I understand the ability to use # for single-line comments and ''' or """ for multi-line comments. I also understand variables and the difference between, Integers, floats, strings, and booleans.</p>
            <p>There is also the aspect of functions, data structures, and libraries within the code to help make advanced changes in the codebase.</p> </section>
